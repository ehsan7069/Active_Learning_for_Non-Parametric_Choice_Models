# Active_Learning_for_Non-Parametric_Choice_Models

This repository contains the implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper **"Active Learning for Non-Parametric Choice Models."** You can access the full text of the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03346).

In the notebook, you will find the following sections:
* _"Choice Model"_ implements the class that encodes the hyper-parameters and the core features of the choice model.
* _"Model Calculator"_ implements the core algorithm presentend in our paper.
* _"Data Analyzer"_ generates systethic data and evaluates the performance of the algorithm.
